This code has two variations of a chat room application.

It is using the TALL stack.

It is using Pusher to handle the broadcasting of messages.

Variant one uses Laravel and AlpineJS and comes with **User Typing Indicators** and **Online Users**. The UI for this resembles WhatsApp.

Variant two uses Livewire (v2) and shows **Online Users**. The UI is just basic, nothing fancy.
